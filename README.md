# My painting project

## Description

Simple drawing app which includes several basic shapes (Rectangle, Line, Circle), several colors to choose and the ability to save the drawing

## The process

* added the uploading of an image and its setting as a background for canvas;
* added console logging of the brush movement - the coordinates (x, y) are being stored inside the array;
* added logging of the eraser movement:
    * the coordinates are supposed to be compared with brush drawn figure coordinates;
    * if they intersect, the drawn figure should be erased;
* to do: add logging for shapes;
